# Retail-Analysis-with-Walmart-Data

Walmart is one of the leading retail stores in the US which makes a huge profit on a daily basis. Their stock market has always been on the higher side and significantly has shown a
greater market share over the years. During the season of festivities, consumers buy a lot of essential and basic amenities, which makes Walmart profitable. But, Walmart do have their
rough days. A constant check on the stock of items, especially basic essential amenities must
be monitored on a daily basis. Failure to do so, may cost a loss in the sales.
Also during festivities, offers given my Walmart should be good or better than their
competitors else this might affect their sales.
This challenge was to predict the sales whether there is more sales that takes place during an
holiday or during a regular working day. Also, we had to find out which store has maximum
sales, which store has a varied sales, Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in
Q3â€™2012.
In this analysis, I have used Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. An accuracy of 72% and
94% was shown during the analysis. The analysis was done to predict the CPI and
Unemployment.
